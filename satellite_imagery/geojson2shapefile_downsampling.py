"""
From GeoJSON to Shapefile with addtional downsampling

The notebook will cover the process of calculating a `Shapefile` based on a `GeoJSON` containing all districts of Munich (and not the city as a whole entity). In particular, the inner borders or shared borders between districts are removed.

Since I also need a version of Munich's border with <500 vertives for USGS Earth Explorer (it only accepts Polygons with <500 vertices), I will also calculate a downsampled version of geopolygon resembling Munich.

There is also a Jupyter notebook (./Munich/geojson2shapefile_downsampling.py) with included plots of the steps and shapes. In fact, this script is derived from this notebook and then a bit tweaked.

# 1. Load the GeoJSON of Munich's districts
# The file is available under https://geoportal.muenchen.de/geoserver/opendata/ows?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=opendata:vablock_stadtbezirk_opendata&outputFormat=application/json

# Munich has two two small enclaves belonging to _Untergiesing-Harlaching_ and _Thalkirchen-Obersendling-Forstenried-F端rstenried-Solln_. Because the Polygon has to be downsampled to <500 Vertices for the USGS Earth Explorer and the algorithm doesn't work with MultiPolygons only with one single Polygon, these will be removed.
# Due to their diminishing small area their contribution can be neglected anyway.
gdf["area"] = gdf.area
city = gdf[["name", "area", "geometry"]]

city_without_exclaves = city.sort_values(by='area')

# Drop the rows with the smallest areas (the first two)
city_without_exclaves = city_without_exclaves.iloc[2:]


# 2. Unify districts to calculate the city boundary
# Merge all district polygons into one single polygon.
# unary_union() unifys all submitted Polygons, ie. removes duplicates/inner borders
polygons = [poly for poly in city_without_exclaves['geometry']]

# 3. Downsample the Polygon
# USGS Earth Explorer only allows Polygons with < 500 vertices. Since the original one has roughly 4000, we have to downsample it. Luckily, there is `shapely` function: `shapely.simplify()`, the documentation can be found [here](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.simplify.html).
